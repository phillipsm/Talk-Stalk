Talk Stalk is a simple application (really, just three or four scripts)
that allow you to track the history of people in your instant messenger buddy
list (XMPP roster).

Talk Stalk is very much a bare-bones project. If you have questions or comments,
send them to the Talk Stalk creator, Matthew Phillips: labratmatt at gmail daht com

Talk Stalk has been tested on the following env:
*Apache 2.2 with mod_php5
*MySQL 5.1
*Python 2.6.1 with the following modules:
 - xmpppy-0.5.0rc1-py2.6.egg
 - MySQL_python-1.2.3-py2.6-macosx-10.6-universal.egg


To setup Talk Stalk, follow along below:

1. Place this directory (yes, the directory that houses this README file) in 
your web server's HTTP Docs directory.

2. Create a MySQL table:

CREATE TABLE `event` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `jid` varchar(2000) NOT NULL,
  `start` timestamp NOT NULL,
  `end` timestamp NOT NULL,
  `duration` bitint unsigned NOT NULL,
  `show_message` varchar(2000) NOT NULL,
  `other` varchar(2000),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

3. Start up the Talk Stalk daemon:
python ts_daemon.py

4. Update the MySQL hostname, user name, and pasword in:
- eventsservice.php
- usersservice.
- ts_daemon.js

5. Update the XMPP username and password in ts_daemon.js. This should be something your 
instant messenger username and password.
